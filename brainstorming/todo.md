# TODOs

## Validation
There are a few different validations we need to do, but currently don't.

### Type checking
- We need to validate that every connection connects two compatible types
  - E.g., only connect two wire vectors if they're the same length
- We need to validate parameters
  - There is a bit of complication here, specifically, with function parameters.
    - These might depend on other parameters to evaluate
