Instruction for Reference Switch with Large CAM on NetFPGA-SUME
----
Modification to setting parameters

$ vim tools/settings.sh
export NF_PROJECT_NAME=lake
export PROJECTS=${SUME_FOLDER}/contrib-projects
export NF_DESIGN_DIR=${SUME_FOLDER}/contrib-projects/${NF_PROJECT_NAME}

For simulation, you have to modify barrier_v1_0_0 rtl for increasing timeout.

Executing simulation and synthesis for hardware testing

$ source tools/settings.sh
$ cd $SUME_FOLDER && make
$ cd $SUME_FOLDER/lib/hw/contrib/cores/db_v1_0_1 
$ cp /path_to_zip/xapp1151_Param_CAM.zip
$ make update && make
